# Marketing Agency Accessibililty Challenge

## Description

I was given the source code and design elements from a marketing agency's webpage which was somewhat lacking in accessibility standards. The source code contained several non-semantic elements and redundant structuring, which was remedied by editing tags and selectors within the HTML and CSS source code. The webpage did not contain all working links and an identifiable title, which was edited within the HTML code as well. The codebase is now more accessible and the webpage is optimized for search engines.

Browse the content on the webpage to explore the agency's marketing strategies. To view the semantic elements and changes made within the codebase, right click the webpage and click "Inspect" to open ChromeDevTools. Alternatively, use Command+Option+I on Mac or Command+Shift+I to open a panel with the codebase.
